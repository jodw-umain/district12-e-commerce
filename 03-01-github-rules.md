# Live document, will change overtime

# Golden Rules

### Do NOT work directly on the main branch.

### Always check what branch you are in.

## When the task is done, open a PR for review:

### 1. Ensure Vercel deployment check passes.

### 2. Ask a teammate for a PR review.

### 3. Fix any issues they request and push to the same PR.

### 4. Once approved, the reviewer merges and deletes the branch on Github.
